# AICTE_INTERNSHIP
# 💧 Water Quality Prediction - RMS

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor`. It was developed as part of a one-month **AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell** in **June 2025**.

## 🌍 Project Motivation

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Monitoring and maintaining water quality is essential for environmental sustainability and public health. This project utilizes real-world water quality datasets to build a machine learning model capable of predicting various chemical indicators of water, which can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

This effort demonstrates the application of **AI in Environmental Monitoring** as part of Edunet Foundation’s internship initiative.

## 🛠️ Overview

In this project, we:

* Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
* Handled missing values and normalized input features
* Applied supervised learning for multi-target regression
* Built a prediction model using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor`
* Evaluated the model using standard regression metrics

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.12**
* **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling and preprocessing
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model and evaluation
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
* \*\*VS Code \*\*– Interactive experimentation and analysis

## 🔍 Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The trained model predicts the following water quality indicators:

* **NH₄** (Ammonium)
* **BOD5 (BSK5)** – Biochemical Oxygen Demand
* **Colloids**
* **O₂** – Dissolved Oxygen
* **NO₃, NO₂** – Nitrate and Nitrite
* **SO₄** – Sulfate
* **PO₄** – Phosphate
* **CL** – Chloride

These are essential indicators used by environmental monitoring agencies.

## 📊 Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:

* **R² Score**
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

It demonstrated acceptable performance for all target parameters, with potential for real-world application and further enhancement via hyperparameter tuning and ensemble learning.
